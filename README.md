# Seeds-clustering

The provided code utilizes various Python libraries for clustering, including pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn-metrics, sklearn.cluster-KMeans, and warnings. The code performs clustering analysis on a dataset containing seed measurements. Here is a summary of the code's functionality and how it works:

1. Importing Libraries: The required libraries for clustering analysis are imported, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and various modules from sklearn.

2. Data Understanding: The code provides a brief description of the dataset, including the columns and their meanings. It loads the seed data from a CSV file using pandas and displays the first few rows of the dataset.

3. Data Visualization: The code generates scatter plots using seaborn's pairplot function to visualize relationships between pairs of variables in the dataset. This visualization helps identify potential clusters and informative features for clustering.

4. Performing PCA: The code applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. It projects the data onto a new set of orthogonal axes (principle components) and creates a scatter matrix plot of the reduced data.

5. K-means Clustering: The code performs K-means clustering on the PCA-transformed data for different numbers of clusters (ranging from 2 to 8). It calculates the silhouette score for each clustering solution to assess cluster separation. The code then creates subplots with scatterplots, where each subplot represents a different number of clusters, and the scatterplot points are colored based on the assigned cluster. The silhouette scores are displayed as titles for each subplot.

6. Silhouette Analysis: The code evaluates the silhouette scores for different cluster assignments using K-means. It creates a bar plot to show the silhouette scores for each data point, helping to understand the quality of the clustering.

7. Determining Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method): The code uses the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering. It calculates the sum of squared distances between the data points and their associated cluster centroids for different values of K (clusters) and plots the results.

8. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering: The code performs GMM clustering on the PCA-transformed data for different numbers of clusters (ranging from 2 to 8). Similar to K-means clustering, it calculates the silhouette score for each GMM clustering solution and creates subplots with scatterplots, where each subplot represents a different number of clusters. The scatterplot points are colored based on the assigned cluster, and the silhouette scores are displayed as titles for each subplot.

9. Model Evaluation: The code evaluates two clustering models, K-means and GMM, using metrics such as inertia, BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), and silhouette score. It prints the evaluation metrics for both models.

10. Result Visualization: The code generates two bar charts to compare the inertia and silhouette scores between the K-means and GMM models.

Overall, the code performs exploratory data analysis, applies dimensionality reduction using PCA, performs K-means and GMM clustering, evaluates clustering solutions using silhouette scores, and visualizes the results to help determine the optimal number of clusters.
